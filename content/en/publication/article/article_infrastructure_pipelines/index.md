abstract: "Infrastructure-as-code tools like Terraform recently have become popular. One main promise of such tools is automation. Still, we rarely see Continuous Delivery implemented for infrastructure code. This article advocates the usage of  Continuous Delivery pipelines for infrastructure provisioning and provides some best practices on how to get started. Our target group is developers who - like us - love to drive automation."
